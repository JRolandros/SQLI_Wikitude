{"Name":"Augmented Reality Wikitude SDK","Id":2447,"Alias":"com.wikitude.xamarin.component","Description":"# Wikitude Augmented Reality Xamarin Component\n\n\nThe Wikitude Xamarin Component enables C# developers to embed an augmented reality view into their Xamarin project. One can create a fully featured app with advanced augmented reality features, including image recognition and tracking, location-based augmented reality and rendering of 3D models in an augmented reality scene.\n\n#### The Wikitude Xamarin Component\n\n* Available for iOS and Android\n* Simple and seamless native Xamarin integration\n* Fully customizable augmented reality (AR) view\n* Full feature set of the Wikitude SDK\n* AR content is purely written in HTML and JavaScript\n\n\n### The Wikitude SDK - Augmented Reality for your own app\n\nThe Wikitude SDK is a software library and framework for mobile apps used to create augmented reality experiences. The SDK supports any kind of location based use case as well as use cases which require image recognition and tracking technology (vision based augmented reality). \n\n\n### How to code for the Wikitude SDK\nThe Wikitude SDK builds heavily on web technologies (HTML, JavaScript, CSS) to allow developers to write cross platform augmented reality experiences. These augmented reality experiences are called ARchitect worlds and are basically ordinary HTML pages that can utilize the ARchitect API to create objects in augmented reality.\n\nIntegrating the Wikitude SDK into your application is done by adding the platform specific view component called `ARchitectView` to your applications user interface. See the setup guide for how to setup a Xamarin project and load an ARchitect World.\n\nGet started with writing augmented reality experiences by viewing through the examples included in the SDK. Each example is explained in detail in this documentation. Additional information about the ARchitect API can be found in the included API specification.\n\n### Free Trial and commercial license\n\nBy default the Wikitude SDK comes with no valid license key. Read this chapter on how to [obtain a free trial key](http://www.wikitude.com/external/doc/documentation/latest/xamarin/triallicense.html).\n\nThen pass your license key into the SDK using the platform specific API. \n \n### The Wikitude Developer Portal\nThe \u003ca href=\"http://www.wikitude.com\" target=\"_top\"\u003eWikitude Developer Section\u003c/a\u003e should be your first stop when you have specific development related questions.

If you like to use it in a commercial, non-commercial or educational environment you need to purchase a according license. All available licenses are listed on the [Wikitude website](http://www.wikitude.com/products/wikitude-sdk/pricing/) and can be purchased directly from [the online store](http:/www.wikitude.com/store)\n","Version":"5.1.1","Summary":"Augmented Reality Component for the Wikitude SDK.","QuickStart":"## Setup Guide Xamarin Component\n\n#### Introduction to the Augmented Reality View\nFrom a technical point of view the SDK adds a UI component called **ARchitectView**, similar to a web view. In contrast to a standard web view the AR View can render augmented reality content.\n\nContent developed for the AR View is written in JavaScript and HTML. \n\n**Note** In this guide we use the terminology `augmented reality experience` and `ARchitect World` synonymously - both of them refer to augmented reality parts of your application. \n\n\u003ca id=\"XamarinSampleApp\"\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\n### Wikitude Sample App - Getting Started quickly\n\nWikitude offers a fully-configured example application as Xamarin app. The application demonstrates the usage of the Wikitude Xamarin Component as well as the usage of the `ARchitectView`. Furthermore the application includes several augmented reality examples which are described in more detail in the [Example section](http://www.wikitude.com/external/doc/documentation/latest/xamarin/samples.html) of this documentation.\n\n#### Automatic Setup of Sample App\n\n1. Clone or download our [GitHub](http://github.com/wikitude/wikitude-xamarin) repository.\n\n2. Open the example application that is located in the `source/sample/{Android/iOS}` folder.\n\n3. Select Debug/Release and click `Run`. Please make sure that you have selected the example application and not only the Component project. Otherwise only the Component project will be build and not the example application.\n\n### Using the Wikitude SDK to create your own augmented reality experience\n\nNow that the Wikitude SDK is added you can start using it inside the Xamarin application to load and display your own augmented reality experience. To communicate between the Architect World and the Xamarin application we added a custom `architectsdk://` protocol and a native callback mechanism. Please refer to the example application on how to use them.\n \n\n##### Loading your augmented reality experience\n\nTo load an Architect World simply use the `LoadArchitectWorldFromUrl` method provided by the Wikitude SDK / Xamarin Component. It accepts either an URL pointing to the application bundle or on a remote server. \n\nOn iOS, also the `Start` and `Stop` methods need to be called either when the presented view controller is about to be replaced by another one or the application moves into the background/foreground. Please refer to the example application on how to use both methods and when.\n\n##### Adding communication between Xamarin and ARchitect\n\nIn order to communicate with the augmented reality experience from within the Xamarin application the Wikitude SDK offers the `CallJavaScript(string javaScript)` method. The JavaScript will be evaluated in the context of the augmented reality experience. If the augmented reality experience is not fully loaded at the time this function is called, it will be evaluated as soon at the experience is loaded. \n\nThe Wikitude SDK defines a custom URL protocol which can be used to communicate from the ARchitect World to the Xamarin application. You can set a C# method that is called each time a `document.location = architectsdk://` load request is done. Please refer to the iOS/Android documentation or API reference for more information about the platform specific implementation details. Also the Wikitude Xamarin example application uses the above mentioned URL protocol to communicate between the Architect World and the Xamarin application.\n\nThe Wikitude Component offers more functionality like to inject a custom location or to capture the screen and generate an image that can be shared on Twitter or Facebook. Please also refer to the [platform API documentation and reference](http://www.wikitude.com/external/doc/documentation/latest/xamarin/referencexamarin.html#xamarin-component-reference) for more information about the available APIs.\n  \n\n### Further developer resources\n* \u003ca href=\"http://www.wikitude.com/developer/documentation/xamarin\" target=\"_top\"\u003eFull documentation and additional tutorials\u003c/a\u003e\n* \u003ca href=\"http://www.wikitude.com/developer/developer-forum\" target=\"_top\"\u003eDeveloper Forum\u003c/a\u003e\n* \u003ca href=\"http://www.wikitude.com/download\" target=\"_top\"\u003eWikitude SDK Download\u003c/a\u003e\n* \u003ca href=\"https://plus.google.com/u/0/103004921345651739447/posts\" target=\"_top\"\u003eGoogle+ Page for News\u003c/a\u003e\n* \u003ca href=\"http://www.wikitude.com/newsletter\" target=\"_top\"\u003eWikitude Newsletter\u003c/a\u003e\n","Hash":"b9e079ccb88c9974676e45efec3a4bca","TargetPlatforms":["ios","android"],"TrialHash":null}
